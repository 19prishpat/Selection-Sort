# Sorting Algorithms in Java

This project implements three common sorting algorithms in Java: **Selection Sort**, **Bubble Sort**, and **Insertion Sort**. The program generates a random array of integers and sorts it using these algorithms. 

## Project Description

This Java program demonstrates how various sorting algorithms work by generating a random list of integers and sorting them using **Selection Sort**, **Bubble Sort**, and **Insertion Sort**. It prints the original unsorted array and the sorted arrays for each algorithm.

## Sorting Algorithms

1. **Selection Sort**: Iterates through the array, finds the smallest element, and swaps it with the current element.
2. **Bubble Sort**: Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order, effectively "bubbling" the largest unsorted element to the end of the array.
3. **Insertion Sort**: Builds a sorted array one element at a time by shifting larger elements to the right to make space for the next element.
